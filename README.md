[NightTab][nt] inspired Solidjs UI Kit

## Quick start

Install it:

```bash
npm i night-ui
# or
yarn add night-ui
# or
pnpm add night-ui
```

Use it:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'night-ui'
```

## Project Goals
- [ ] Port the UI kit used in [NightTab][nt]
- [ ] Publish it as an npm package
  - [ ] Maybe: Publish a web components version
- [ ] Refactor it to be slimmer
- [ ] Rewrite [NightTab][nt] as a proof of concept.


## Q&A
- **Why?**: I thought it would be a fun project to both reverse engineer one of my favorite extensions (again) and build out a UIKit. The second half of that is going to come later after the port is done. I want it to be extremly faithful to [NightTab][nt] so Porting it is going to be the best bet. Once its ported, I can refactor it down.
- **Why solidjs?**: Solidjs is much more optimized than react and boasts a more intuitive mental model. (_Also, I like it a lot. So theres that._)
